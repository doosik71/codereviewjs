### Building for Windows

To build a standalone Windows application using Electron:

1. **Ensure all processes are closed:** Before building, make sure no previous instances of the application are running and no file explorer windows are open in the project's `dist` directory or its subfolders. This is crucial to avoid file lock errors during the build process.
2. **Run the build command:**

    ```sh
    npm run electron-build
    ```

    This command will first build the Next.js application for production and then package it into a Windows executable using Electron.
3. **Find the executable:** The generated installer (`.exe` file) will be located in the `dist` directory (e.g., `dist\codereviewjs Setup 0.1.0.exe`).
